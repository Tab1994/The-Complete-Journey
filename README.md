# The-Complete-Journey
A look into the data of 2,500 frequent retail shoppers over a two-year period with a focus on campaign successes through A/B testing and customer conversion.

For this analysis I used the Dunnhumby 'The Complete Journey' data set. The data set can be found here : https://www.dunnhumby.com/source-files/

This dataset contains over 5 million rows split into 8 different tables from a group of 2,500 frequent households for a particular retailer. 

Through my initial exploration I decided to focus primarily on A/B testing and customer conversions. 

I used the following five questions to lead my analysis: 
- What do our customer demographics look like? 
- How long did we run each of our 30 campaigns? 
- Which campaigns had the most redemptions over the two-year period? 
- Which implementation type performed the best? 
- What was the customer conversion rate based on coupon redemptions? 

This project was completed using Excel, SQL, Python and PowerPoint.
